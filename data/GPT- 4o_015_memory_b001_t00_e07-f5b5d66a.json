Khan in 2015. I have been focusing on determining the publication history of Pietro Murano to find his first authored paper. Attempts to access his Google Scholar profile were unsuccessful due to a 429 error. The arXiv paper searcher found a paper titled \"Anthropomorphic User Interface Feedback in a Sewing Context and Affordances\" by Pietro Murano, but it did not confirm if it was his first paper. PubMed and IEEE Xplore searches did not yield useful results. I then attempted to find his personal webpage, and the latest Google search identified a webpage titled \"Publications - Pietro Murano\" that likely lists all his publications.\n</memory>\n\n<reflection>\nThe last action resulted in finding a webpage titled \"Publications - Pietro Murano,\" which seems to be a personal page listing his publications. This is a successful outcome as it provides a direct source that might list his works in chronological order, potentially revealing his first authored paper. This is significant progress towards the task goal of identifying the earliest paper authored by Pietro Murano. The outcome suggests the next step should involve exploring this webpage to extract the list of publications and identify his first paper.\n</reflection>\n\n<plan>\nThe next step is to access the \"Publications - Pietro Murano\" webpage directly and examine the list of publications for the earliest paper authored by him. This plan is helpful because it utilizes a direct source that likely contains the comprehensive publication history needed to identify his first work. I expect this action to yield a chronological list of his publications, allowing us to determine the title of his first authored paper.\n</plan>\n\n<action>\ntool: url_text_extractor\nparameters: {\"url\": \"https://pietromurano.org/publications.html\"}\n</action>']\n\nYou are now at step 13.\nCurrent Observation: Tool 'url_text_extractor' executed.\nResult: {\n  \"url\": \"https://pietromurano.org/publications.html\",\n  \"extracted_text\": \"Pietro Murano - Publications\\nPietro Murano\\nPublications\\nHome\\nResearch\\nLecturing\\nAdministration\\nPopular Media\\nContact\\nThis section lists all my publications and where possible the publications are included.
